Examples of calling the platform APIs of CSPaper, part of Scholar7.

Platform homepage:
https://cspaper.org/platform

This repository is intended to provide practical, runnable examples for common platform services provided by CSPaper. The first example included here is Agentic Review, with additional examples for paper ranking, correctness check, reference check, and code check planned next.

## Getting Started

### 1. Create a Python virtual environment

From the repository root:

```bash
$ python3 -m venv env
$ source env/bin/activate
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
$ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure your environment

Create a local `.env` file from the provided example:

```bash
$ cp env-example .env
```

Then edit `.env` and set your values:

```dotenv
API_KEY=your-api-key-here
API_URL=https://cspaper.org
```

`API_KEY` is used for authentication to the CSPaper platform APIs.

## Agentic Review

The easiest way to test agentic review API is visiting https://cspaper.org/platform/review via your browser without the need of sign-in. You need to paste-in your API Key on top of the page.

To submit agentic review jobs in batch, follow the steps below:

### Prepare input papers

By default, the scripts expect your paper PDFs in:

```text
./papers
```

Each PDF in that folder is treated as one paper submission. Example layout:

```text
platform-examples/
  papers/
    paper-1.pdf
    paper-2.pdf
    paper-3.pdf
```

You can use a different input folder with `--paper-dir`, but if you do, use the same `--paper-dir` value for both submission and polling.

### Submit review jobs in batch

Run from the repository root:

```bash
$ python agentic-review/submit-batch.py --agent-id="<your-agent-id>"
```

Replace `<your-agent-id>` with the review template you want to use.

The current list of available agent IDs is provided here:
https://cspaper.org/platform/review

`agent-id` examples:

```text
AAAI_main technical_2026_1
ACL_main_2026_1
AISTATS_main_2026_1
CoG_technical and vision_2025_1
CVPR_main_2026_1
EMNLP_main_2025_1
ICLR_main_2026_1
ICML_main_2026_1
ICML_position_2025_1
TMLR_regular_2026_1
... ...
```

What the script does:

1. Reads all `*.pdf` files from the paper directory.
2. Submits each paper to the platform review API.
3. Writes submission records to:

```text
./output/submissions.json
```

> **Note**: Before sending new requests, the submission script checks existing records in `submissions.json`.
> A paper is normally skipped when the same combination of `filename` and `agent_id` is already recorded.
> This means the same PDF with the same `agent_id` will be skipped, while the same PDF with a different `agent_id` can still be submitted.
> If the recorded job status is `FAILED`, the script will submit a new job instead of skipping it, so rerunning the submission command is the normal way to retry failed papers.
> Skip and retry decisions are printed clearly in the terminal.

### Poll review results

Polling is needed because review jobs are asynchronous. The main reasons are

1. Each review can take anywhere from about 1 minute to 15 minutes, depending on the complexity of the selected review agent and the paper being reviewed.
2. The number of review jobs that can run concurrently is limited, and that shared capacity is also used by end-user review requests submitted through UI.

To poll the review results, simply run:

```bash
$ python agentic-review/poll-result-batch.py
```

If you used a custom paper directory during submission, use the same one here:

```bash
$ python agentic-review/poll-result-batch.py --paper-dir ./papers
```

Concretely, the polling script does the following:

1. Reads `./output/submissions.json`.
2. Checks the review status for each stored job.
3. Waits and retries until each job is completed, failed, or timeout is reached.
4. Saves each completed result as a Markdown file in `./output` named after pattern `<paper_stem>__<agent_id>.md`, such as `./output/tmlr-5831__<your-agent-id>.md`

### Example run

Example submission:

```text
$ python agentic-review/submit-batch.py --agent-id "<your-agent-id>"
Found 3 PDF(s): 3 to submit, 0 already recorded
  submitted tmlr-5831.pdf -> job 856f388c-d5cd-4409-b3bf-3e0c8279dc49
  submitted tmlr-6121.pdf -> job 41f6623d-6de0-4bcb-bd9e-fc30f651992d
  submitted tmlr-6722.pdf -> job c6125489-afd3-49a1-be98-a3d7118b9cb1

3 submitted: 3 ok, 0 failed
Submissions saved to output/submissions.json
```

Example polling:

```text
$ python agentic-review/poll-result-batch.py

Polling 3 job(s) — interval 30s, timeout 1800s

  3 job(s) still pending — waiting 30s...
  3 job(s) still pending — waiting 30s...

  1 job(s) still pending — waiting 30s...
  [COMPLETED] tmlr-6722.pdf -> output/tmlr-6722__<your-agent-id>.md

No pending reviews. 3 completed, 0 failed.
```

### Review job visibility in the platform UI

You can also inspect submitted jobs directly in the platform UI:
https://cspaper.org/platform/review

After entering your API key on that page, you can check available review templates and monitor submitted review jobs there as well.

![Review Jobs UI](images/review-jobs-ui.png)

### Error handling
The submitted jobs may fail due to LLM resouce exshausion, occasional invalid JSON payload, etc. In this case, during polling, you will see:

```text
$ python agentic-review/poll-result-batch.py

Polling 3 job(s) — interval 30s, timeout 1800s

  WARN fetch 1339b7c6-04e2-4c7a-9507-e61fc950e0d4: Job lookup returned HTTP 404; treating as terminal failure.
  [FAILED] tmlr-5831.pdf -> output/tmlr-5831__<your-agent-id>.md
```

In this case, you just need to rerun the submission command:

```bash
$ python agentic-review/submit-batch.py --agent-id="<your-agent-id>"
```

It will automatically resubmit the failed papers.
